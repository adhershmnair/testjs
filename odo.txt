Now in your pc there are 2 branches with name master and dev/js
1. master main in git from my pc.
2. dev/js in your pc

dev/js create just now in step 1. Also you are in dev/js branch automatically.


now you can create a file js.txt. Add some content or something.

Then You need to add this file and commit file with a comment see below example.


2.
									git add .
									git commit -m "Created Js.txt. and added some content"


Then you need to push this to git. Before that you need to pull from git.

3.

Now if any changes done in master branch in github will download to your pc git.
If there something to merge. Just do a CTRL+X and Enter.
